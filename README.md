## Team Collaboration:

#### Branching: Use Git branches for feature development and bug fixes.
#### main branch: For the stable, released version of the code.
#### Pull Requests: Create pull requests for merging changes into the main branch. This allows for code reviews and discussions before merging.
#### Commit Messages: Write clear and concise commit messages that describe the changes made in each commit.

## Technical Requirements:

#### Python: Utilize Python's data structures (lists, dictionaries) and functions for game logic implementation.
##### Matrix Representation: Represent the game board as a 3x3 matrix (list of lists) for efficient game state management and winning condition checks.

## Game Logic:
#### Implement functions for:
#### Checking for valid moves.
#### Placing marks on the board.
#### Checking for winning conditions (rows, columns, diagonals).
#### Checking for draws.
#### Consider implementing an AI player for single-player mode.
